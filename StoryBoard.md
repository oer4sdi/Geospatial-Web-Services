# OER on Geospatial Web Services (work in progress!)       
         	           	
## 1. Overview

In this Open Educational Resource (OER) you will learn which forms of **Geospatial Web Services** exist, how they are structured, how they can be integrated into an open source GIS (QGIS) and published through GeoServer. 

**After you have completed the following OER, you will know:**
* what Geospatial Web Services and OGC standards are
* where to find and identify usefull Geospatial Web Services and learn how they are structured
* how to integrate Web Services in QGIS and work with Data from it 
* how to publish your own Web Services with GeoServer 

**The OER is structured as follows**

1. Overview
2. Thematic Background 
3. Excercises and Guides
4. Quiz 
5. Wrap up 

This tutorial is mainly designed for participants who want to spend about ... minutes on improving their skills in integrating Data from Geospatial Web Services. You should have some basic knowledge of GIS Software.

This tutorial was developed at the Institute of Geodesy at Bochum University of Applied Sciences in close cooperation with the University of Münster and the University of Bochum. Main author is Fabian Przybylak under the direction of Prof. Dr. Carsten Keßler.
